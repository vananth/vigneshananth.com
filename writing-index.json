    "excerpt": "I've been thinking about where evals fit into product development and how they interact with A/B tests. The problem: when an LLM sits in a product's critical path, A/B testing alone stops working. It tells you that engagement dropped, not what broke. This post is about why evals have become essential, how they differ from traditional A/B testing, and why building a robust eval set is actually a competitive advantage in a world where building something new has never been cheaper."
