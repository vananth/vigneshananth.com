  <h1>Hi, I’m Vignesh.</h1>
  <p>I’m a Data Scientist at Meta Super Intelligence Labs (MSL); I work on the Llama Developer Platform.</p>


  <p>At MSL, I work on understanding the Open Source LLM ecosystem, and how to make LLM's work for real use cases; how to make them reliable, performant, and actually deliver user value.
  In practice, this means digging into pre-training data, combing through evals, and reading reams of model outputs.
  You’d be surprised what you find in there.</p>

  <p>Like most people in tech at some point, I worked on ads; I was part of the team at Meta that built and ran Click-to-WhatsApp Ads 
  and helped develop Lead Ads for Business Messaging.</p>
  
  <p>Before that, I spent a few years at FLYR Labs, an airline pricing startup, bringing machine learning into legacy revenue systems.
  Despite working on pricing data for three years, I still pay as much for a flight as anyone else.</p>

  <p>I’m a quantitative economist by training. That means I learned to run linear regressions the hard way and am the first person to ask if something is correlation or causation.</p>

  <p>I’m most energized when I'm working on 0 --> 1 projects; happiest when I’m learning, building, and shaping ambiguous problems into real products that work.</p>
